# Snake

Abstract
Snake, a game mostly notably known for being one of the only games that was playable on old Nokia phones. When asked to create an android game, I thought it would be exciting to mix a bit of the old with a bit of the new. Bringing finger gestures to an old-fashioned game which was once played by physical number buttons. In this report, I will be demonstrating my game and will explore the aesthetics as well as what happens behind the screen.



Introduction
The game which I have created is Snake. The user controls the snake by swiping the screen in the userâ€™s choice of direction. The aim of the game is to eat all the red squares without making the snake kill itself. Which can be done by the following way: by eating the black squares or by running into itself. If the user does one of those actions, then the level will restart and the user will have to start again. The game itself has 3 levels, each level gets progressively harder and the snake is more longer and quicker to begin with.
